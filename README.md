## ✨ 设计初衷

### 1. 什么是工程教育
工程教育的理念是以成果导向教育，亦称能力导向教育、目标导向教育或需求导向教育，具体内涵包括：以学生为中心：教学过程考虑学生学什么，怎么帮助学生学，学生学得如何；以反向设计为指导：从外界需求决定培养目标，以培养目标决定毕业要求，以毕业要求决定课程体系；以持续改进为动力：动态评价并改进培养目标、毕业要求、课程体系和课程大纲。

### 2. 什么是工程教育认证
工程教育认证是指在中国工程教育专业认证协会（以下简称认证协会）的领导下组织开展的工程学科认证的过程。认证协会是由热心中国工程教育的有关团体和个人自愿结成的全国性、非营利的会员制社会团体组织。

开展工程教育认证的目标是：构建中国工程教育的质量监控体系，推进中国工程教育改革，进一步提高工程教育质量；建立与工程师制度相衔接的工程教育认证体系，促进工程教育与企业界的联系，增强工程教育人才培养对产业发展的适应性；促进中国工程教育的国际互认，提升国际竞争力。

工程教育认证工作的基本程序包括6个阶段：申请和受理、学校自评与提交自评报告、自评报告的审阅、现场考查、审议和做出认证结论、认证状态保持。

### 3. 为什么进行定性化专业计算
 达成度的计算是工程认证的核心，我们认为定量化计算，无法准确衡量一个学生得学习能力，毕竟人不是可以量化的，所以我们提出了定性化的概念

## ✨ Original design intention



### 1. What is Engineering education

The concept of engineering education is results-oriented education, also known as competence-oriented education, goal-oriented education or demand-oriented education. Its specific connotation includes: student-centered education: the teaching process considers what students learn, how to help them learn, and how well they learn; Under the guidance of reverse design, the cultivation goal is determined from the external demand, the graduation requirement is determined by the cultivation goal, and the curriculum system is determined by the graduation requirement. Driven by continuous improvement: dynamically evaluate and improve training objectives, graduation requirements, curriculum system and curriculum outline.



### 2. What is Certification in Engineering Education

Engineering education certification refers to the process of engineering discipline certification organized and carried out under the leadership of China Engineering Education Professional Certification Association (hereinafter referred to as the Certification Association). The Certification Association IS a national, non-profit, member-owned social organization formed voluntarily by relevant organizations and individuals who are enthusiastic about engineering education in China.



The objectives of engineering education certification are: to build the quality control system of engineering education in China, to promote the reform of engineering education in China, and to further improve the quality of engineering education; To establish the engineering education certification system connected with the engineer system, promote the connection between engineering education and business circles, and enhance the adaptability of engineering education personnel training to industrial development; To promote the international mutual recognition of China's engineering education and enhance its international competitiveness.



The basic procedure of engineering education certification includes six stages: application and acceptance, school self-evaluation and submission of self-evaluation report, self-evaluation report review, on-site inspection, review and make the certification conclusion, certification status maintenance.



### 3. Why qualitative professional calculation

The calculation of achievement degree is the core of engineering certification. We believe that quantitative calculation can not accurately measure a student's learning ability, after all, people can not be quantified, so we put forward the concept of qualitative
